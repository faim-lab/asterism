#+TITLE: Asterism

An asterism is a pattern people can see in stars, and while there is a fixed set of true constellations we can come up with as many asterisms as we like.

Asterism is a project in operationalizing operational logics to the extent that they can be composed to form game engines.

* Repository Structure

The =prototypes= directory contains games programmed directly, with an eye towards operational logics rather than, say, object-oriented or component-based approaches.

That's it for now.
