//! # Asterism
//!
//! An asterism is a pattern people can see in stars, and while there is a fixed set of true
//! constellations we can come up with as many asterisms as we like.
//!
//! Asterism is a project in operationalizing operational logics to the extent that they can be
//! composed to form game engines.
//!
//! The descriptions of logics in the modules are lightly modified from Prof Osborn's dissertation.
